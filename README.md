# Blockchain transaction signature RS extraction script

This script connects via RPC to a Bitcoin or compatible blockchain node, scans blocks within a specified range, and extracts the ECDSA signature R and S values from transaction input scripts (`scriptSig`). The extracted information is then saved to a specified output file.

## Features

*   Connects to a blockchain node via JSON-RPC.
*   Fetches block data for a specified block height range.
*   Iterates through each transaction in a block (skipping Coinbase transactions).
*   Parses and extracts ECDSA signature R and S values from the `scriptSig` of transaction inputs (`vin`).
*   Writes the transaction ID containing signatures, along with the corresponding R and S values, to the specified output file.
*   Includes an RPC connection retry mechanism and a prompt for manual reconnection ('P' key).
*   Displays a progress bar during processing.

## Requirements

*   Python 3
*   `requests` library (installable via `pip install requests`)
*   A running Bitcoin Core or compatible node with RPC service enabled.

## Setup

Before running the script, you **must** modify the following RPC connection settings at the beginning of the script to match your node's configuration:

```python
# RPC Connection Settings
RPC_USER = 'Your_RPC_Username'
RPC_PASSWORD = 'Your_RPC_Password'
RPC_PORT = 'Your_RPC_Port' # Default is usually 8332 (mainnet) or 18332 (testnet)
RPC_URL = f'http://127.0.0.1:{RPC_PORT}' # Modify the IP address if the node is not on localhost
```
# Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing three required arguments: start block height, end block height, and the output filename.
```
python3 extract_data.py <start_block> <end_block> <output_file>
```



Parameters:

<start_block>: The block height to start scanning from (integer).

<end_block>: The block height to end scanning at (integer, inclusive).

<output_file>: The path and name of the file to save the extracted results.

# Example:
```
python3 extract_data.py 700000 700010 signatures_output.txt
```


This command will scan blocks from 700000 to 700010 (inclusive) and save the extracted transaction IDs and signature R/S values to the signatures_output.txt file.

# Output Format

The output file will contain content in the following format:
```
Transaction ID: <Transaction Hash>
  Signature - R: <Signature R value (hex)>, S: <Signature S value (hex)>
Transaction ID: <Another Transaction Hash>
  Signature - R: <Signature R value (hex)>, S: <Signature S value (hex)>
  Signature - R: <Another Signature R value from the same transaction (hex)>, S: <Another Signature S value from the same transaction (hex)>
```


# Notes

The script assumes the RPC node is running at http://127.0.0.1. If your node is on a different host or uses a different protocol (e.g., HTTPS), be sure to modify the RPC_URL.

The signature extraction method relies on regular expression matching and basic parsing of the scriptSig.asm format. It might not cover all complex or non-standard script types.

If the RPC connection fails, the script will attempt to reconnect several times. If failures persist, it will prompt the user to press 'P' to manually trigger a reconnection attempt.
